Data Wrangling and EDA for Indigenous Australian Population and Australian Immunisation rates data

Indigenous Australians are part of Australian society everywhere, but some parts of the country have larger populations than others. In this project, I perform various analysis tasks and visualization, to examine the relationship between the distribution and age of Indigenous Autralians and gains insights into relations and trends over time. The data files used in this project were originally from the Australian Bureau of Statistics(ABS) and Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, but have been condensed and put into a simpler format.

IndigAusPopData_by_region data file contains yearly data regarding the estimated resident population of Indigenous Australians, grouping by indigenous regions, between 2016 and 2031.

IndigAusPopData_by_state data file contains yearly data regarding the estimated resident population of Indigenous Australians, grouping by state or territory, between 2016 and 2031.

AusImmunisationData data file contains yearly data regarding the number of 1, 2 and 5 years old Australian children fully or partially immunised in various Primary Health Network (PHN) areas.
